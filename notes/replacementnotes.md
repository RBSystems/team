# Replacement steps for PI 06/28/07

## Case Hardware Failure
> If the failed pi is still responding on the network you'll have to unplug them before readressing the replacement.
> You can perform steps 2+ AFTER putting the new pi in the room, but they can be done before as well. 

1. Flash a replacement pi (You can have a PI preflashed, see the note about pre-flashing.)
        
1. SSH into the replacement pi from a terminal (PUTTY or bash) via: 

        ssh pi@{HOSTNAME}.byu.edu
        e.g. ssh pi@ITB-1101-CP1.byu.edu
1. Download the readdressing script onto the replacement pi
 
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byuoitav/raspi-deployment-microservice/master/changeroom.sh
1. Run the readdressing script on the replacement pi 

        sudo chmod +x ./changeroom.sh
        sudo ./changeroom.sh
1. When prometed, enter the new hostname and IP address
1. Reboot the pi
   
        sudo reboot
1. The pi will now control the room, so be careful touching it when it comes back up
1. Replace the broken PI with the new one. 
1. Reflash the broken SD Card before placing in a new pi. 

## Case Software Broken
1. Follow the same steps as above, but you can simply take the sd card to replace the old sd card. 



### Pre-Flashing note
> When a pi is preflashed donâ€™t leave it disconnected from the network for too long (a week or so) as the database transactions may get pushed out of the ledger and the pi may not sync properly, requiring a re-flash.
