# mass-usp-compiler
It's a bit of a pain to have to manually compile a bunch of Simpl files after your first clone of the TEC repository. This tool helps alleviate some of that pain by compiling the files en-masse.

### Usage
Run `mass-usp-compiler.cmd` in a Command Prompt with administrator privileges in the directory you cloned the TEC files to.
